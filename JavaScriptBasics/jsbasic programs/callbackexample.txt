callbacks: 
1.callbacks is a normal javascript function ,which is passesed as an argument to another function.
2.it is a design pattern.
3.In nodejs program does not execute line by line.
4.program is executeed asynchronuesly



lets consider the hotel example:

senario one:normal  programmming languages

step 1: customer ordered the item to server

step 2:server take the order from customer and send the order to cheff.

step 3:server will wait untill cheff prepares the food.

step 4: if second customer visits to hotel  ,he has to wait for server to come back from server.

step 5:once the server come from cheff and delivere the first customer order ,then he ill take the second customer order and process.

this is time taking and executing tasks one by one in normal programs.


senario two:callback nodejs 

step 1: customer ordered the item to server

step 2:server take the order from customer and send the order to cheff.

step 3:After sending the order to cheff, server ill tell the cheff that once the food is ready click the button(here it is like calling callback function).

step 4:parllally food is preparing by cheff in kitchen and server ill come back to take the second customer order.

step 5:once the food is ready fro the first customer  cheff will trigger the callback to server to indicate food is ready for first customer.

step 6: server ill stop taking the order from the second customer order for a while ,and server ill go back to cheff and delivers the food for first customer.

step 7: after delivering food to first customer server ill countinue the remaing operations of the second customer.
